## Implementation Details

The improvements were implemented by:

2. Enhancing the Terminal class to better handle input and output
3. Improving the component method for better UI/UX
4. Adding platform-specific command execution
5. Fixing output formatting to match VS Code terminal experience

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the terminal:
