Below is a detailed scope document for building an AI Agent that integrates both Spotify and GitHub functionality using the Pydantic AI framework. This document outlines the architecture, core components, external dependencies, testing strategy, and a list of relevant documentation pages from the provided resources.

────────────────────────────
1. Overview

The goal is to create an AI agent that handles two distinct tasks:
• Recommending songs from Spotify (via spotify_agent)
• Creating and managing GitHub repositories (via github_agent)

Through Pydantic AI’s modular framework and multi-agent applications, the design will leverage pre-built components along with custom integrations to meet the requirements.

2. Architecture Diagram

Below is a high-level architecture diagram using text/mermaid notation:

────────────────────────────
• User Request Input: The interface (CLI, API endpoint, etc.) through which a user supplies commands.
• Agent Manager: Coordinates between the two agents, parses user instructions, and delegates tasks.
• Spotify Agent: Communicates with Spotify’s endpoints to retrieve/recommend songs.
• GitHub Agent: Manages repository creation and operations through GitHub’s API.
• Common Tools & Utilities: Shared components (logging, error handling, message formatting, etc.) from Pydantic AI.
• External Services: Spotify and GitHub APIs for real-world operations.

────────────────────────────
3. Core Components

a) Agent Manager (Coordinator)
   • Role: Acts as the central controller, interpreting user requests and routing them to the appropriate sub-agent.
   • Components:
     - Request Parser: Uses Pydantic’s model parsing to validate and structure input.
     - Task Dispatcher: Determines whether a Spotify or GitHub task (or both) is required.
     - Response Aggregator: Gathers results from sub-agents and formats the final output.

b) Spotify Agent (spotify_agent)
   • Role: Provides song recommendations based on user preferences.
   • Key Functions:
     - Query Builder: Formulates requests using user parameters.
     - API Connector: Interfaces with Spotify’s API endpoints.
     - Response Formatter: Normalizes data from Spotify for user display.
   • Dependency: Spotify API client library, authentication utilities.

c) GitHub Agent (github_agent)
   • Role: Manages repository operations including creation, updates, commits, and other repository management tasks.
   • Key Functions:
     - Repository Creator: Creates new repositories.
     - Repository Manager: Executes management tasks such as issue tracking, commit management, and collaborator settings.
     - API Interface: Calls GitHub’s API endpoints using authentication tokens.
   • Dependency: GitHub API client library, security and rate-limiting modules.

d) Common Utilities and Tools
   • Logging and Monitoring: To trace operations and errors.
   • Error Handling: Standardized exceptions and recovery steps.
   • Message & Format Tools: Tools such as format_as_xml, and pydantic_graph utilities for representing data.
   • Configuration: Settings from https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/settings/ to manage environment-specific parameters.

────────────────────────────
4. External Dependencies

• Pydantic AI SDK: Core framework for building and orchestrating agents.
• Spotify API: For song recommendations (authentication, rate limiting, etc.).
• GitHub API: For repository management, using GitHub’s OAuth or personal access tokens.
• HTTP Client Libraries: Requests or HTTPX for REST interactions.
• Utility Libraries: Logging (built-in or structured logging libraries), error tracking.
• Deployment Infrastructure: Depending on production needs (Docker, CI/CD pipelines, etc.).

Relevant external documentation:
   - https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/ (Agent composition and multi-agent configuration)
   - https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/agent/ (Details on crafting Pydantic agents)
   - https://ai.pydantic.dev/common-tools/ (For logging, error handling, and common patterns)
   - https://ai.pydantic.dev/settings/ (Configuration management)

────────────────────────────
5. Testing Strategy

a) Unit Testing
   • Write tests for each core component (Agent Manager, Spotify Agent, GitHub Agent).
   • Validate input processing using Pydantic’s model validation.
   • Mock external API responses to simulate Spotify and GitHub interactions.

b) Integration Testing
   • Test full workflows by simulating a complete user request from input through agent delegation.
   • Ensure that the Agent Manager correctly aggregates responses from both agents.
   • Leverage Pydantic AI’s evaluation utilities (see pydantic_evals/) for comprehensive scenario tests.

c) System Testing
   • End-to-end tests with actual connectivity to Spotify and GitHub (in a staging environment) to ensure real-world operability.
   • Use CI/CD pipelines to run automatic regression tests on code updates.

d) Performance and Load Testing
   • Validate that requests are handled under expected loads.
   • Check API rate-limiting and error recovery in each agent.

e) Documentation and Examples
   • Include sample scripts and usage examples, referencing examples from https://ai.pydantic.dev/examples/ (e.g., weather-agent, chat-app).

7. Additional Considerations

• Security:
   - Secure API keys for Spotify and GitHub.
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs.
   - Implement error monitoring and exception management strategies.

• Scalability:
   - Design agent components to be pluggable and scalable using container orchestration if necessary.
   - Ensure that agents have fallbacks in the event of external API rate limit or downtime.

• Extensibility:
   - Keep the design modular so that additional agents (e.g., for other platforms) can be integrated in the future.
   - Use Pydantic’s extensible models for reusing validation and configuration across agents.

Conclusion

By combining the Spotify and GitHub agents behind an Agent Manager with clear responsibility segregation, robust testing, and dependency management, this AI agent will streamline both song recommendation workflows and GitHub repository management. The provided documentation links and design principles from the Pydantic AI documentation will guide the development and integration of these components.

This scope document serves as a blueprint to reliably build, test, and maintain the multi-functional AI agent.
