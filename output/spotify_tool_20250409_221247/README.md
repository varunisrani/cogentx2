# MCP Tools Package

## Overview

The MCP Tools Package is a collection of utilities designed to simplify and enhance the management of various MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) tasks. This package includes a single tool, Tool 1, which provides functionalities to streamline processes that can be automated or optimized within MCP environments. The goal of this package is to deliver a straightforward interface for users to efficiently interact with MCP systems without unnecessary complexity.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the MCP Tools Package, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: You can install the package via pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install mcp-tools
   ```

2. **API Keys**: If Tool 1 requires API access, you will need to obtain the necessary API keys from the respective MCP service. Once you have the keys, store them in a secure location. You can set them as environment variables or include them in a configuration file.

   Example of setting an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export MCP_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

3. **Configuration**: If your tool requires configuration settings, you can create a configuration file named `config.json` in the root directory of your project. The structure of the configuration file should look like this:

   ```json
   {
       "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
       "additional_setting": "value"
   }
   ```

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the MCP Tools package is organized as follows:

```
mcp-tools/
├── mcp_tools/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── tool1.py
├── config.json
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

- `mcp_tools/`: This directory contains the core functionalities of the MCP tools.
- `tool1.py`: The implementation of Tool 1, which can be invoked directly for various tasks.
- `config.json`: Optional configuration file for storing API keys and other settings.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the package.

## Direct Usage Examples

### Tool 1

To use Tool 1, you can directly call its functions from your Python script. Below are some usage examples:

#### Example 1: Basic Functionality

```python
from mcp_tools.tool1 import Tool1

# Initialize Tool 1
tool = Tool1(api_key='your_api_key_here')

# Execute a basic function
result = tool.perform_basic_task(param1='value1', param2='value2')
print(result)
```

#### Example 2: Advanced Functionality

```python
from mcp_tools.tool1 import Tool1

# Initialize Tool 1 with configuration
tool = Tool1()

# Execute an advanced function
response = tool.execute_advanced_task(param1='value1', param2='value2', option=True)
print(response)
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **API Key Issues**: If you experience issues related to authentication, ensure that your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions. Double-check the environment variable or the configuration file.

2. **Dependency Errors**: If you encounter errors related to missing modules, ensure that you have installed all required dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Function Errors**: If a function is not behaving as expected, verify that you are passing the correct parameters. Refer to the function documentation for the expected input types and formats.

4. **Network Issues**: If there are issues connecting to the MCP service, check your internet connection and ensure that the service is operational.
