# Common Errors in tools.py and Their Fixes

This file documents common errors that can occur in tools.py files and their automatic fixes.

## Tool class names are inconsistent across files

**Error Type:** class_naming_inconsistency

**Solution:** Detected class naming inconsistency. Adding alias class for backward compatibility.

## Tool class doesn't have 'Tool' suffix

**Error Type:** missing_tool_suffix

**Solution:** Detected tool class without 'Tool' suffix. Renaming for consistency.

## Tool methods called differently across files

**Error Type:** inconsistent_method_names

**Solution:** Detected inconsistent method names. Standardizing method names.

## Missing alias class for backward compatibility

**Error Type:** missing_alias_class

**Solution:** Adding alias class with MCPTool suffix for backward compatibility.

## Applied Fixes in this Project

- **class_naming_inconsistency**: Detected class naming inconsistency. Adding alias class for backward compatibility.
- **missing_alias_class**: Adding alias class with MCPTool suffix for backward compatibility.


## Class Naming Validation
