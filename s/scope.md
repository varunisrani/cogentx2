Below is a detailed scope document for an AI agent that combines Spotify song recommendations and GitHub repository management. This document outlines the agent’s architecture, core components, external dependencies, testing strategy, and provides a list of relevant documentation pages from Pydantic AI.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Overview and Objectives  
─────────────────────────────

Objective: Build an AI agent that, upon user request, can perform two main actions:
• Recommend songs from Spotify by interfacing with Spotify’s API.
• Manage GitHub repositories (create, update, and organize) by interfacing with GitHub’s API using a dedicated github_agent.

The solution leverages the Pydantic AI framework to orchestrate agents by delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents (spotify_agent and github_agent). This modular design ensures separation of concerns and easier testing and maintenance.

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the agent:

           +-----------------------------------+
           |    External APIs & Services       |

           |  - GitHub (For repository management)|
           +-----------------------------------+

Key Points of the Diagram:  
• The User Interface receives natural language requests.  
• The Agent Orchestrator parses and interprets these requests to decide whether to call spotify_agent or github_agent (or both).  
• Common Tools and Messaging components (based on Pydantic’s messaging API) help maintain context and transform data between internal and external formats.  
• External APIs expose functionalities that the agents consume through secure HTTP requests with proper authentication.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Core Components  
─────────────────────────────

A. Agent Orchestrator  
   • Role: Acts as the central dispatcher.  
   • Responsibilities:
     - Parse incoming user requests.
     - Identify the nature of the request (Spotify recommendation vs. GitHub management).
     - Route requests to the appropriate sub-agent.
     - Aggregate and format the responses using Pydantic’s common tools and messaging formats.

B. spotify_agent  
   • Role: Handles recommendations and search requests.  
   • Responsibilities:
     - Interface with the Spotify API to fetch song recommendations.
     - Implement logic for search, filtering, and providing personalized song suggestions.
     - Translate Spotify API responses into a consistent format for the orchestration layer.

C. github_agent  
   • Role: Manages GitHub repository actions.  
   • Responsibilities:
     - Interface with the GitHub API for creating repositories, adding/committing code, and generally managing repository metadata.
     - Secure handling of GitHub credentials and tokens.
     - Translate GitHub responses into structured outputs.

D. Common Tools & Messaging Layer  
   • Role: Provides shared utilities and message formatting (using Pydantic’s messaging API).  
   • Responsibilities:
     - Validate input and output data models.
     - Handle error propagation and logging.
     - Ensure that message formats comply with the Pydantic format_as_xml and result APIs when needed.
  
E. External API Wrappers  
   • Includes adapters or wrappers that interface securely with the Spotify and GitHub API endpoints.
   • Ensures authentication, API rate limit management, and error handling.

─────────────────────────────  
4. External Dependencies  
─────────────────────────────

• Pydantic AI Framework:  
   - Core library for agent definition, messaging, and validation.
   - APIs: agents, common_tools, messaging, etc.

• Spotify API:  
   - Requires developer credentials and OAuth tokens.
   - Used by spotify_agent to get recommendations and search metadata.

• GitHub API:  
   - Requires Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or OAuth setup.
   - Used by github_agent for repository CRUD operations.

• HTTP Client Libraries:  
   - For making RESTful API calls (e.g., requests or httpx).

• Python Environment:  
   - Python 3.8+ (recommended for compatibility with Pydantic and modern async features).

• Testing Libraries:  
   - pytest for unit and integration tests.
   - Pydantic Evals for evaluating agent conversations and multi-agent responses (if applicable).

─────────────────────────────  
5. Testing Strategy  
─────────────────────────────

A. Unit Testing  
   • Test each component (Agent Orchestrator, spotify_agent, github_agent, and wrappers) in isolation.
   • Validate data models using Pydantic schemas.
   • Use mocking (e.g., via unittest.mock or pytest-mock) to simulate external API responses.

B. Integration Testing  
   • End-to-end tests to ensure that the orchestration layer correctly routes requests to the proper sub-agent.
   • Simulate end-to-end flows by providing example user requests and verifying the aggregated output.
   • Use Pydantic Evals (from https://ai.pydantic.dev/pydantic_evals/) to simulate agent conversations and verify accuracy.

C. External API Simulation  
   • Use sandbox or mock environments provided by Spotify and GitHub (or simulate via HTTP response mocks) to test external API interactions safely.
   • Validate error handling and rate-limit responses.

D. Smoke Testing and End-to-End Validation  
   • Verify that the entire system functions when deployed in a staging environment.
   • Run tests that cover common user journeys (song recommendation followed by repository creation).
