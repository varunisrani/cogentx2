Add AI-driven merge functionality to merge_agent_templates

This commit adds a two-step approach to merging agent templates:
1. Rule-based merging for baseline code generation (existing functionality)
2. AI refinement of the merged code to improve quality and coherence

Changes:
- Created new module `ai_merge_helper.py` with functions for AI-driven code refinement
- Added test scripts to verify the AI refinement functionality
- Created example script showing how to use the AI-driven merge
- Added documentation explaining the new functionality

The AI refinement process:
- Takes code generated by rule-based merge
- Uses an AI model to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability
- Preserves all functionality from the original templates
- Keeps backups of original files for safety

This implementation follows the recommended approach of separating the
mechanical code combination from the intelligent code refinement, making
the process more robust and maintainable.
